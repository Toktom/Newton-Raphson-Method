# Newton-Raphson Method Algorithm in Python

The project here contains the Newton-Raphson Algorithm made in Python as a homework in the beginning of the course of Computational Numerical Methods (MTM224 - UFSM).

## Explanation

In numerical analysis, the Newton's Method (or Method of Newton-Raphson), developed by Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, aims at estimating the roots of a function. For this purpose, an initial approximation is chosen, after this, the equation of the tangent line of the function at this point and the intersection of it with the axis of the abscissa, in order to find a better approximation for the root, is calculated. By repeating the process, an iterative method is created to find the root of the function.

In mathematical notation the method is described in the following formula:
